<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning methods, YOLOv8 and mmdetection, for the detection of diseases in chest X-ray images. The combination of these two powerful frameworks allows for accurate and efficient identification of abnormalities in medical images.


## Introduction

Medical image analysis plays a crucial role in early disease diagnosis. This project focuses on leveraging YOLOv8 and mmdetection, two popular deep learning frameworks, to detect diseases in chest X-ray images. The models are trained on large datasets to recognize various abnormalities, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.

  <h3>YOLOv8</h3>

  <p>YOLOv8, short for "You Only Look Once version 8," is an efficient and accurate object detection model. It divides an
    image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell.</p>

  <h3>mmdetection</h3>

  <p>mmdetection is an open-source framework for object detection. It supports a variety of pre-trained models and
    provides flexibility for customizing models. In this project, mmdetection is used for its versatility and
    robustness.</p>
